To activate the script, simply type your search terms into the google search bar, then hit CTRL + SHIFT + B. This will enter the search modifiers and hit enter, starting the search.
make sure you only do so when you have the Google search bar selected.
## how to modify
If you would like to add your own sites to avoid, AI or not, you can simply add the site with the following phrase: -site:  an example, if blocking Prompt Hero, would be -site:pompthero.com  it is important this this is the exact url, so watch out for .net, .ai, .co.uk, etc.
if you would like to remove keywords, follow the example that is in the code. -"ai"
make sure your additions stay within the first ' and {Enter}' to be included, and to not break the script.
